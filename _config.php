/**
 * silvershop/core is a SOFT dependency. The Review model, company/website reviews (on SiteConfig), the
 * standalone /shop-review form, helpful votes, Q&A, moderation admin, aggregate-rating JSON-LD and the
 * external-provider display adapters all work on any SilverStripe 6 site. Only the shop surfaces need core —
 * product reviews, the verified-purchase Review↔Order link, the order-triggered invitation stack — so they
 * are attached here behind class_exists() guards and are simply never wired when core is absent.
 *
 * This mirrors silvershop/newsletter's guarded _config.php and keeps the module installable (and testable)
 * without silvershop/core, while lighting up every shop feature when it is present.
